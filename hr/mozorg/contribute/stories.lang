;My favorite part of being a Mozillian is the global community. I like to think of us as a “family” where we accept each other openly and are free to speak our minds while we work together.
Najbolja stvar kod Mozillianera je globalna zajednica. Volim misliti o nama kao o „obitelji”, gdje jedni druge otvoreno prihvaćamo i gdje slobodno razmijenjujemo naše misli, dok radimo zajedno.
