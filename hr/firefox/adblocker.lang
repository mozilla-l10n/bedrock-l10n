Kako zaustaviti prikazivanje previše oglasa i spriječiti poduzeća da te prate na mreži. Priručnik za blokiranje oglasa u web-pregledniku Firefox.


;The ad blocker – a secret weapon against annoying ads.
Bloker oglasa – tajno oružje protiv dosadnih oglasa.


;So many ads, so little patience… It’s time to stop the madness.
Puno oglasa, malo strpljenja … Vrijeme je da se zaustavi ludilo.


;The average person sees an average of 4,000 ads a day. If you think that’s too many, an ad blocker is your new best friend.
Prosječna osoba dnevno vidi u prosjeku 4000 oglasa. Ako misliš da je to previše, bloker oglasa je tvoj novi najbolji prijatelj.


;An ad blocker is a piece of software that can be used to block ads, and they work in two ways. The first way is when an ad blocker blocks the signal from an advertiser’s server, so the ad never shows up on your page. Another way ad blockers work is by blocking out sections of a website that could be ads.
Bloker oglasa je softver koji služi blokiranju oglasa, a radi na dva načina. Prvi način je blokiranje signala s poslužitelja oglašivača, kako se oglas nikada ne bi prikazao na tvojoj stranici. Drugi način je blokiranje dijelova web-stranice koji bi mogli biti oglasi.


;These ads might be loud video ads, ads that follow you around the web, trackers, third-party cookies, and more. To use an ad blocker, you can search for ad blocker add-ons that are available in your browser. <a href="%(firefox)s">Firefox</a>, for example, has <a href="%(addons)s">this list of approved ad blocker add-ons</a>. Click on this list (or ad blockers that are approved for your browser) and see which fits your needs.
Ti bi oglasi mogli biti glasni video oglasi, oglasi koji te prate po webu, programi za praćenje, kolačići trećih strana i još mnogo toga. Za upotrebu blokator oglasa, potraži dodatke za blokiranje oglasa koji su dostupni u tvom pregledniku. <a href="%(firefox)s">Firefox</a>, na primjer, <a href="%(addons)s">ima ovaj popis odobrenih dodataka za blokiranje oglasa</a>. Klikni ovaj popis (ili blokatore oglasa koji su odobreni za tvoj preglednik) i pogledaj koji odgovara tvojim potrebama.
