;Comparing Firefox Browser with Microsoft Edge
Firefox  براؤزر کا  Microsoft Edge سے موازنہ کرنا


;With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced its Edge browser to compete with Firefox and Chrome making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and Microsoft eventually announced plans to relaunch Edge as a Chromium-based browser (Chromium of course being Google’s Open Source browser project).

Even so, users were slow to adopt it and Microsoft eventually announced plans to relaunch Edge as a Chromium-based browser (Chromium of course being Google’s Open Source browser project).


;Here we’ll compare our Firefox Browser to the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge in terms of privacy, utility, and portability, to help you have a better understanding of which browser better suits your needs and preferences.
رازداری ، افادیت اور پورٹیبلٹی کے معاملے میں ہم یہاں اپنے Firefox براؤزر کا مقابلہ کرومیم پر مبنی Microsoft Edg سے کریں گے تاکہ آپ کو اس بات کی بہتر تفہیم حاصل کرنے میں مدد مل سکے کہ کون سا براؤزر آپ کی ضروریات اور ترجیحات کے مطابق ہے۔


;Edge is integrated into the Windows 10 platform and runs in a sandbox environment, meaning it isolates programs and prevents malicious programs from spying on your computer. It has a built-in SmartScreen that scans the reputation of sites you visit and blocks suspicious sites. To enhance privacy, Edge allows you to use biometrics or a PIN with Windows Hello instead of passwords for online authentication.

To enhance privacy, Edge allows you to use biometrics or a PIN with Windows Hello instead of passwords for online authentication.


;However, Edge saves some of your private data and sends it back to Microsoft with Windows updates. At 45 cryptically worded pages long, the privacy policy for Edge is unlikely to be read or understood by the average user.
تاہم ، Edge آپ کے کچھ نجی ڈیٹا کو محفوظ کرتا ہے اور اسے Windows کی تذکاری کے ساتھ Microsoft کو واپس بھیج دیتا ہے۔ 45 بہ آسانی سے الفاظ کے صفحات لمبے ، Edge کی رازداری کی پالیسی اوسط صارف کے پڑھنے یا سمجھنے کا امکان نہیں ہے۔


;At Firefox, our <a %(attrs)s>privacy policy</a> is transparent and in plain language. We actually put a lot of work into making sure it was straightforward and easy to read. We pride ourselves in protecting our users security and privacy. With Enhanced Tracking Protection now on by default, we block 2000+ trackers automatically. Trackers are those little pieces of code that try to piece together what you're doing across multiple internet sites to build a composite and detailed picture of who you are, compromising your privacy all just to target better ads.

;In Firefox, Private Browsing mode automatically erases your browsing information like passwords, cookies, and history, leaving no trace after you close out the session. Edge on the other hand, actually records browsing history in their private mode (called “InPrivate”) and it’s a relatively easy task for someone to reconstruct your full browsing history, regardless of whether your browsing was done in regular or InPrivate mode.

;Both browsers are relatively equal in terms of data encryption. However, if online privacy and transparency are important to you, then Firefox is clearly a better choice here.

;Firefox is a fast and open source browser, which means users can customize their browsing experience in every way possible. Firefox also allows the casual user several different ways to customize the UI with applying different themes and toolbar configurations. Since our browser has always been open source we have a large following of devoted developers who have created an extensive library of add-ons and browser extensions.

;Since Edge has moved to the processor intensive Chromium platform, you can expect it to run a little slower, especially if you have multiple programs running at once. However, with Chromium platform comes a massive library of extensions as well as a decent level of UI customization that Edge did not have before it’s move to Chromium.

;Edge has some nice UI features, like their tab previews which can make it easy to find the right open tabs if you’ve got a lot of them open. Another helpful tab-related feature lets you set aside any active tabs that you aren’t using but don’t want to close down.

;Firefox features a scrolling tab interface, which keeps tab information viewable and scrolls them horizontally instead of shrinking them down to just favicon size. Also whenever you open a new tab, our <a %(attrs)s>Pocket feature</a> suggests relevant articles and content for you. Plus with Pocket, you can also save articles, videos, and other content with one click, for reading at a later time.

;Firefox and Edge both offer excellent reading modes. With Firefox you just tap on the small icon in the search bar and the browser strips down all unnecessary elements and presents you a clean looking article. In Edge you just tap on the small book icon and browser to get a clean easy-to-read UI.

# "Out of the gate" means from the very start. Alternative: "From the start,". Race horses are held behind a gate that is opened to release all the horses at the same time at the start of the race, so a horse that leads the race from the very start is said to lead "right out of the gate."
;Out of the gate, Firefox has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, Edge’s compatibility with Google’s Chromium platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.

;With Internet Explorer, Microsoft learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made Edge available for macOS and Android. The software is now readily available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.
Internet Explorer,  کے ساتھ ، Microsoft نے پلیٹ فارمز میں اپنی دستیابی کی کمی سے سبق حاصل کیا اور Edge کو macOS اور Android کے لئے دستیاب کردیا۔ یہ سافٹ ویئر اب iOS ، Android ، Windows اور Mac پر آسانی سے دستیاب ہے۔


;Firefox has been available on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS and Linux for years. And as you would expect with any modern browser, Firefox lets you log in with a <a %(attrs)s>free account</a> and sync data such as passwords, browsing history, bookmarks, and open tabs between your computer, tablet and phone. It also allows you to sync across platforms as well.
Firefox برسوں سے iOS، Android، ونڈوز ، macOS اور Linux  پر دستیاب ہے۔ اور جیسا کہ آپ کسی بھی جدید براؤزر سے توقع کریں گے ، Firefox آپ کو <a %(attrs)s> مفت اکاؤنٹ </a> کے ساتھ لاگ ان کرنے اور ڈیٹا  ککو سنک جیسے پاس ورڈز ، براؤزنگ سبقات ، بُک مارکس ، اور آپ کے کمپیوٹر کے درمیان کھلی ٹیبز ، گولی اور فون۔ یہ آپ کو پلیٹ فارمز میں بھی سنک کی اجازت دیتا ہے۔


;Edge also allows you to connect your associated Microsoft account and sign in to sync your favorites, history, passwords, and more between your computer and iOS or Android devices, although some Android tablets are not currently supported.

;Aside from sucking up a lot of computing power, Edge running on Chromium has answered a lot of users’ needs for functionality and features. But there’s still a lot to account for in terms of the browser’s privacy protections. It’s our assessment that Firefox is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a %(attrs)s>Mozilla</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.
بہت سی کمپیوٹنگ طاقت کو چوسنے کے علاوہ ، کرومیم پر چلنے والی Edge  نے فعالیت اور خصوصیات کے ل بہت ساری صارفین کی ضروریات کا جواب دیا ہے۔ لیکن براؤزر کی رازداری کے تحفظ کے معاملے میں ابھی بھی بہت کچھ باقی ہے۔ ہمارا یہ اندازہ ہے کہ Firefox اب بھی زیادہ تر لوگوں کے لئے اپنی روزمرہ کی زندگی میں استعمال کرنے کے لئے ایک بہتر انتخاب ہے ، نہ صرف فعالیت پر بلکہ زیادہ اہم بات یہ ہے کہ ہم صارف کے ڈیٹا کو کس طرح اکٹھا کرتے ہیں ، ہم کیا جمع کرتے ہیں ، اور ہم اس کے ساتھ کیا کرتے ہیں اس میں ہماری شفافیت پر۔ کیونکہ ہماری بنیادی کمپنی <a %(attrs)s> Mozilla</a> ، ایک غیر منافع بخش تنظیم ہے جو انٹرنیٹ کی رازداری اور آزادی کے لئے وقف ہے ، لہذا جب صارفین کے  ڈیٹا کی بات کی جاتی ہے تو ہمارے پاس ترجیحات کا ایک الگ سیٹ ہوتا ہے۔


;The bottom line is that while we suggest using Firefox, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
