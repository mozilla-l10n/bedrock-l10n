;Comparing Firefox Browser with Opera
Firefox  براؤزر کا Opera سے موازنہ کرنا


;The Firefox Browser and Opera are two of the earliest browsers on the scene still releasing frequent updates. While Opera has not reached the same level of user adoption as Firefox or Google Chrome, it’s maintained a relatively stable and loyal base over a sustained period of time. In this review, we’ll compare the Opera browser with our Firefox browser in terms of security and privacy, utility, and portability to help you choose which browser might be the best fit for you.

;Opera’s privacy policy lacks some specificity in its explanation of which types of information it collects and how, in certain sections, it says they collect names of account holders, IP addresses and search terms. What seems confusing and troubling is the section about International data transfers; when, how often and why they need to transfer your data internationally is not explained.

;Firefox’s <a %(attrs)s>privacy policy</a> is very transparent in describing what personal information we collect with the only end goal being to give you greater control over the information you share online.

;As far as actual privacy protections in the Opera browser, it does offer a robust Private mode that allows you to surf the web without the browser tracking your activity. Also in normal browsing mode, you can also turn off some data collection features by digging into the settings to enable the ad blocker and adjust other security features.

;With the latest version of Firefox, <a %(attrs)s>Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> is turned on by default in normal browsing mode, so you don’t have to mess around with the settings just to protect yourself from trackers. With Enhanced Tracking Protection, Firefox actively blocks thousands of third-party trackers that try to follow you around the web. You are provided with a personalized protection report that shows how often Firefox blocked third-party cookies, social media trackers, fingerprinting tools and cryptominers as you browse the web.

;We make Firefox for people like you, who care deeply about personal privacy and security. That's why we collect so little info about users and are transparent about how we use that info. It's hard to know how Opera is operating from a privacy perspective. While there are robust privacy features, how they themselves collect and share your data is murky. Firefox remains consistent in what we say and what we do in protecting your privacy.

;There’s no debate that Opera is a feature-packed browser with a clean user interface and strong customization options. Because Opera is built on Chromium, it can take advantage of most of Google Chrome’s vast extension library. Firefox also features a large <a %(attrs)s>extension library to browse</a>, but not quite as large as Chrome’s.
اس میں کوئی بحث نہیں ہے کہ Opera ایک فیچر سے بھر پور براؤزر ہے جس میں صاف صارف انٹرفیس اور حسب ضرورت مضبوط اختیارات ہیں۔ چونکہ Opera  کرومیم پر بنایا گیا ہے ، لہذا یہ Google Chromeکی بیشتر وسیع ایکسٹینشن لائبریری سے فائدہ اٹھا سکتا ہے۔ Firefoxمیں ایک بڑی <a %(attrs)s> براؤز کرنے کے لئے ایکسٹینشن لائبریری </a> بھی موجود ہے ، لیکن یہ کروم جتنی بڑی نہیں ہے۔


;Like Firefox, Opera delivers a scrolling tab experience, which means that when you open more tabs than will fit on screen, it scrolls them off screen instead of just continuously shrinking them down. Also both Firefox and Opera have a screenshot tool that lets you capture a snapshot of your screen or part of the page. However, the Opera tool doesn’t give you the ability to create one huge capture of the whole webpage, only the visible portion.

;Opera provides a lot of hidden utility within its simple and manageable interface. For example there’s built-in support for messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger. There’s also a news reader that aggregates articles from your choice of sites and news outlets. The parallel feature to this on Firefox is called <a %(attrs)s>Pocket</a>. Pocket is a free service for Firefox account holders that makes it easy to find and save interesting articles and videos from all around the web. In addition, it recommends a variety of articles that expand your knowledge base curated by real, thoughtful humans.
Opera اپنے سادہ اور انتظام کرنے والے انٹرفیس کے اندر ڈھیر ساری چھپی ہوئی افادیت فراہم کرتی ہے۔ مثال کے طور پر Facebook Messenger جیسی میسجنگ ایپس کیلئے بلٹ ان سپورٹ ہے۔ ایک نیوز ریڈر بھی ہے جو آپ کی پسند کی سائٹس اور خبروں کے دکانوں سے مضامین جمع کرتا ہے۔ Firefox پر اس کی متوازی خصوصیت کو <a %(attrs)s> Pocket</a> کہا جاتا ہے۔ Pocket Firefox اکاؤنٹ رکھنے والوں کے لئے ایک مفت خدمت ہے جو پورے ویب سے دلچسپ مضامین اور ویڈیوز تلاش کرنا اور محفوظ کرنا آسان بناتا ہے۔ اس کے علاوہ ، یہ متعدد مضامین کی بھی سفارش کرتا ہے جو حقیقی ، فکر مند انسانوں کے ذریعہ تیار کردہ آپ کے علم کی اساس کو وسعت دیتے ہیں۔


;In terms of head to head utility, Opera and Firefox are close competitors. Opera may have an advantage in one aspect with its compatibility with and access to Chrome’s huge extension library. But one significant factor to consider is the fact that Opera, because it’s built on Chromium, is a processor-hungry browser with its RAM consumption comparable to Chrome, which is known for its high CPU usage.

# "Ex" is a former partner or spouse, as in "ex-boyfriend" or "ex-wife." Alternative: "former partner"
;Both Firefox and Opera are compatible across every platform including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Firefox account holders can easily sync their bookmarks, passwords, open tabs, and browsing history across all their signed into devices. The same is true for Opera users with an account. However, many sites, especially old sites that haven’t been updated in years, block the latest version of Opera entirely. So if visiting places like your Ex’s old blog is important, take heed, you may not be able to access some of the dustier corners of the internet if you use Opera.
Firefox اور  Opera دونوں Windows، Mac، Linux، Android اورiOS سمیت ہر پلیٹ سبقفارم میں ہم آہنگ ہیں۔ Firefox اکاؤنٹ رکھنے والے اپنے بُک مارکس ، پاس ورڈز ، کھلی ٹیبز اور براؤزنگ سابقات کو آسانی سے اپنے سبھی سائن ان شدہ آلات میں سنک کرسکتے ہیں۔ اکاؤنٹ  رکھنے والے Opera صارفین کے لئے بھی یہی بات ہے۔ تاہم ، بہت ساری سائٹیں ، خاص طور پر پرانی سائٹس جو برسوں میں اپ ڈیٹ نہیں ہوتی ہیں ، Opera کے تازہ ترین ورژن کو مکمل طور پر روکتی ہیں۔ لہذا اگر آپ کے سابقہ پرانے بلاگ جیسی جگہوں کا دورہ کرنا ضروری ہے تو ، دھیان رکھیں ، اگر آپ Opera  کا استعمال کرتے ہیں تو آپ انٹرنیٹ کے کچھ گندے ہوئے کونوں تک رسائی حاصل نہیں کرسکتے ہیں۔


;In addition to the regular mobile app, Opera has two other mobile versions of its browser: Touch and Mini. Touch is light on features but it’s designed to use on the go with only one hand. The Mini version aims at lowering data usage and increased speeds on slow connections by downgrading images and stripping away content.

;Most major browsers these days, with the exception of Safari, work seamlessly across platforms and browsers. Opera and Firefox are no exception with both browsers providing excellent portability across every device.

;Overall, Opera is a solid browser, with a clean interface and a lot of useful features available. There are, however, some serious privacy concerns as well as an issue with it using a lot of processing power. Although Opera has some really terrific ease of use features, we still believe Firefox remains a superior browser based on performance and with a transparent user-privacy stance and strict privacy protections.
