;Comparing Firefox Browser with Microsoft Internet Explorer
Firefox 浏览器与 Microsoft Internet Explorer 之间的比较


;While Microsoft’s Internet Explorer still comes pre-installed on most Windows-based PCs, clearly Microsoft would prefer you to use their Edge browser, which is set as the default when you purchase.
尽管大多数基于 Windows 的 PC 上仍预装了 Microsoft Internet Explorer，但显然Microsoft 更希望您使用其 Edge 浏览器，该浏览器在出厂时被设置为默认浏览器。


;Microsoft discontinued its Internet Explorer brand several years ago, in favor of its updated Edge browser for Windows 10. However, slow adoption for Edge created room for Internet Explorer to live on, mainly for business compatibility reasons.
几年前，微软终止了其 Internet Explorer 品牌，取而代之的是现代化的 Windows 10 Edge 浏览器。然而，由于业务兼容性的原因，Edge 的缓慢推进为 Internet Explorer 创造了生存空间。


;Here we’ll compare our Firefox Browser with Internet Explorer in terms of security, utility, and portability. We’ll help you understand the differences between how a modern browser like Firefox that adheres to web standards compares with the browser you may be using for business purposes or out of old habits that die hard.
在此，我们将 Firefox 浏览器与 Internet Explorer 在安全、实用、跨平台方面进行比较。帮助您了解遵循 Web 标准的现代浏览器，与为了商业目的或因历史原因不得不用的浏览器之间有什么区别。


;If you haven’t moved on from using Internet Explorer, the security risk factor alone should be enough to convince you. <a %(attrs)s>Microsoft’s own security chief has warned</a> millions of people who continue to use Internet Explorer as their main web browser that they are placing themselves in “peril.”
如果您还没有停止使用 Internet Explorer，那么仅凭安全风险因素就足以说服你。<a %(attrs)s>Microsoft 安全主管警告称</a>，数百万继续使用 Internet Explorer 作为默认浏览器的用户，正处于“危险之中”。


;Microsoft is no longer supporting new development for Internet Explorer, which means security concerns are rampant. Microsoft openly acknowledges the fact that vulnerabilities exist within basically every version of Internet Explorer.
Microsoft 早已停止对 Internet Explorer 的开发支持，这意味将出现大量安全问题。 Microsoft 曾公开承认，基本上每个版本的 Internet Explorer 都存在漏洞。


;So what’s the solution if your company is running outdated apps that only work on Internet Explorer? Our best advice for you personally is, don’t mix business with pleasure. The simple thing to do is download and use a more secure browser like Firefox. Then, if you need to do things like check your personal email or shop online, you can just switch over to the more secure browser. The bottom line is, if Microsoft is warning people not to use Internet Explorer, don’t use it. Your online privacy and security are not worth risking because you (or your company) have a hard time breaking an old habit. We make Firefox with security and privacy features like <a %(lockwise)s>Lockwise</a>, our password manager, private browsing and lots of other add-ons that help us make the web safer for you. Also, our <a %(privacy)s>Privacy Policy</a> is straightforward: we tell you what we know about you, and why we collect that information. All of these things obviously go beyond what Internet Explorer offers, and even what other modern browsers like Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge offer.

;Alarmingly, 4 to 5% of all desktop web traffic comes through Internet Explorer. That might not seem like a lot, but in reality it means millions of people are being served a poor internet experience with slow loading and rendering times, pages that won’t display properly — all on top of the security issues already discussed.
令人担忧的是，仍有 4 - 5% 的桌面网络流量来自 Internet Explorer。看似不多，但事实上，这意味着有数以百万计的人正忍受着，诸如加载渲染缓慢、页面显示异常等糟糕的互联网体验——还有上面已经论述过的安全问题。


;Really the only reasons to use Internet Explorer are for developers to test what their sites look like on an older browser or if a company has business-critical apps that only work with the Internet Explorer browser.
确实，使用 Internet Explorer 的唯一原因多半是开发者需要在较旧的浏览器上测试其网站是否工作正常，或公司尚有仅兼容于 Internet Explorer 浏览器的关键业务应用程序。


;On the other end of the spectrum, Firefox is one of the most frequently updated browsers, and comes loaded with lots of useful and interesting features, like <a %(pocket)s>Pocket</a> that suggests interesting content every time you open a new tab. Our unified search and web address bar, or <em>Awesome Bar</em> as we call it, also gives you suggestions based on your existing bookmarks and tags, history, open tabs and popular searches. And with a free Firefox account you also get access to all your settings and <a %(products)s>our other Firefox products</a> on any device simply by signing in. Plus the peace of mind of knowing your browser is proactively working to protect your personal data.

# "sunset" here means Microsoft is officially ending production of Internet Explorer. Alternative: "retire"
;As Microsoft has made the move to sunset the Internet Explorer browser, it no longer supports any version for iOS, and has never been available for Android. Which means unless you’re running a Windows-based laptop or desktop, you won’t have access to your bookmarks, browsing history, saved passwords, and other information that modern browsers sync across devices.
由于 Microsoft 已淘汰 Internet Explorer 浏览器，因此它不再支持 iOS 的任何版本，也不会支持 Android。这意味着，除非您运行的是 Windows 系统笔记本电脑或台式机，否则您将无法访问书签、浏览历史、保存的密码以及其他现代浏览器在设备之间同步的信息。


;Firefox works on any platform, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS. Which also means you can sync all your information across platforms. So if you’re browsing on a Windows-based laptop, you can pick up where you left off when you move to browsing on your iPhone or Android device. This convenience should come standard with any modern web browser, and is sorely lacking with Internet Explorer.
Firefox 能够在任何平台上运行，包括 Windows、macOS、Linux、Android 和 iOS。这也意味着您可以跨平台同步所有信息。因此，若您在 Windows 系统笔记本电脑上进行浏览，则可在 iPhone 或 Android 设备上无缝浏览。这种便利性应该成为任何现代 Web 浏览器的标配，但 Internet Explorer 却极度缺乏。


;There was a time not so long ago where Internet Explorer was the most popular and widely used browser in the world. Times have changed and so has technology, but unfortunately Internet Explorer has pretty much stayed the same. Microsoft itself openly implores users to stop using Internet Explorer and instead switch to their newer Chromium-based Edge browser.
许久前，Internet Explorer 是世界上最流行、应用最广泛的浏览器。但时代变了，技术也变了，但不幸的是，Internet Explorer 却几乎没有变。微软自己也公开恳求用户停止使用 Internet Explorer，转而使用新的 Chromium 内核 Edge 浏览器。


# "Nana" is a common nickname for a grandmother in many English-speaking countries. Use a similar name for a grandmother in your language or culture.
;Our opinion is just to go with a trusted, private browser with a track record of delivering a great experience across devices. In a head-to-head comparison, it’s really no contest at all. Firefox is hands down the winner across all assessment categories. If you do find yourself at Nana’s house firing up Internet Explorer, maybe you want to do Nana a favor and <a %(attrs)s>download Firefox</a> for her.
