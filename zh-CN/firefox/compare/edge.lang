;Comparing Firefox Browser with Microsoft Edge
Firefox 浏览器与 Microsoft Edge 之间的比较


;With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced its Edge browser to compete with Firefox and Chrome making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and Microsoft eventually announced plans to relaunch Edge as a Chromium-based browser (Chromium of course being Google’s Open Source browser project).
在 Windows 10 中，Microsoft 推出了其 Edge 浏览器以与 Firefox 和 Chrome 竞争，并成为预装在其所售 PC 上的默认浏览器。即便如此，还是用者寥寥。最终，微软宣布计划将推出基于 Chromium 的“新 Edge 浏览器”（Chromium 即为 Google 的开源浏览器项目）。


;Here we’ll compare our Firefox Browser to the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge in terms of privacy, utility, and portability, to help you have a better understanding of which browser better suits your needs and preferences.

;Edge is integrated into the Windows 10 platform and runs in a sandbox environment, meaning it isolates programs and prevents malicious programs from spying on your computer. It has a built-in SmartScreen that scans the reputation of sites you visit and blocks suspicious sites. To enhance privacy, Edge allows you to use biometrics or a PIN with Windows Hello instead of passwords for online authentication.
Edge 已集成至 Windows 10 平台，并在沙盒环境中运行，这意味着它可以隔离程序并防止恶意程序在您的计算机上进行间谍活动。它内置有 SmartScreen 筛选器，可以扫描您访问的网站的信誉，以阻止可疑网站。为了增强隐私性，Edge 还允许您使用 Windows Hello 中的生物识别手段或 PIN 码代替用于网络身份验证的密码。


;However, Edge saves some of your private data and sends it back to Microsoft with Windows updates. At 45 cryptically worded pages long, the privacy policy for Edge is unlikely to be read or understood by the average user.

;At Firefox, our <a %(attrs)s>privacy policy</a> is transparent and in plain language. We actually put a lot of work into making sure it was straightforward and easy to read. We pride ourselves in protecting our users security and privacy. With Enhanced Tracking Protection now on by default, we block 2000+ trackers automatically. Trackers are those little pieces of code that try to piece together what you're doing across multiple internet sites to build a composite and detailed picture of who you are, compromising your privacy all just to target better ads.

;In Firefox, Private Browsing mode automatically erases your browsing information like passwords, cookies, and history, leaving no trace after you close out the session. Edge on the other hand, actually records browsing history in their private mode (called “InPrivate”) and it’s a relatively easy task for someone to reconstruct your full browsing history, regardless of whether your browsing was done in regular or InPrivate mode.

;Both browsers are relatively equal in terms of data encryption. However, if online privacy and transparency are important to you, then Firefox is clearly a better choice here.
两款浏览器在数据加密方面相当。然而，如果网络隐私和透明度对您来说很重要，那么 Firefox 显然是一个更好的选择。


;Firefox is a fast and open source browser, which means users can customize their browsing experience in every way possible. Firefox also allows the casual user several different ways to customize the UI with applying different themes and toolbar configurations. Since our browser has always been open source we have a large following of devoted developers who have created an extensive library of add-ons and browser extensions.

;Since Edge has moved to the processor intensive Chromium platform, you can expect it to run a little slower, especially if you have multiple programs running at once. However, with Chromium platform comes a massive library of extensions as well as a decent level of UI customization that Edge did not have before it’s move to Chromium.
由于 Edge 已迁移至 CPU 密集型的 Chromium 平台，因此可以预期它运行的速度会变慢，特别是同时运行多个程序时。好的一方面是获得了庞大的扩展库，以及相当不错的 UI 自定义水平，这在 Edge 迁移到 Chromium 之前是不存在的。


;Edge has some nice UI features, like their tab previews which can make it easy to find the right open tabs if you’ve got a lot of them open. Another helpful tab-related feature lets you set aside any active tabs that you aren’t using but don’t want to close down.
Edge 有一些很不错的 UI 功能，如标签页预览，如果您打开了很多标签页，可助您快速找到所需页面。另一项与标签页相关的实用功能是，您可以将任何当前未用但不想关闭的活跃标签页暂时“搁置”。


;Firefox features a scrolling tab interface, which keeps tab information viewable and scrolls them horizontally instead of shrinking them down to just favicon size. Also whenever you open a new tab, our <a %(attrs)s>Pocket feature</a> suggests relevant articles and content for you. Plus with Pocket, you can also save articles, videos, and other content with one click, for reading at a later time.

;Firefox and Edge both offer excellent reading modes. With Firefox you just tap on the small icon in the search bar and the browser strips down all unnecessary elements and presents you a clean looking article. In Edge you just tap on the small book icon and browser to get a clean easy-to-read UI.
Firefox 和 Edge 均提供了出色的阅读模式。使用 Firefox，您只需点击地址栏中的小图标，浏览器就会删除所有不必要的元素，为您呈现一篇干净的文章。在 Edge 中，您只需点击“书”图标，即可获得一个干净易读的 UI。


;Firefox also includes lots of handy built-in features by default like <a %(attrs)s>Enhanced Tracking Protection</a>, a built-in screenshot tool, large file sending and more.
Firefox 默认还包含许多便捷的内置功能，例如<a %(attrs)s>增强型跟踪保护</a>、内置截图工具、大文件发送功能等等。


# "Out of the gate" means from the very start. Alternative: "From the start,". Race horses are held behind a gate that is opened to release all the horses at the same time at the start of the race, so a horse that leads the race from the very start is said to lead "right out of the gate."
;Out of the gate, Firefox has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, Edge’s compatibility with Google’s Chromium platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.

;With Internet Explorer, Microsoft learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made Edge available for macOS and Android. The software is now readily available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.
Microsoft 吸取了 Internet Explorer 缺乏跨平台可用性的教训，使 Edge 可用于 macOS 和 Android。现在，该软件在 iOS、Android、Windows 和 Mac 上均可使用。

It also allows you to sync across platforms as well.

;Aside from sucking up a lot of computing power, Edge running on Chromium has answered a lot of users’ needs for functionality and features. But there’s still a lot to account for in terms of the browser’s privacy protections. It’s our assessment that Firefox is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a %(attrs)s>Mozilla</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.

;The bottom line is that while we suggest using Firefox, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
