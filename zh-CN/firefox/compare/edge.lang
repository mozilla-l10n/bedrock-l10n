;Comparing Firefox Browser with Microsoft Edge
Firefox 浏览器与 Microsoft Edge 之间的比较


;With Windows 10, Microsoft introduced its Edge browser to compete with Firefox and Chrome making it the default browser pre-installed on millions of PCs sold. Even so, users were slow to adopt it and Microsoft eventually announced plans to relaunch Edge as a Chromium-based browser (Chromium of course being Google’s Open Source browser project).
在 Windows 10 中，Microsoft 推出了其 Edge 浏览器以与 Firefox 和 Chrome 竞争，并成为预装在其所售 PC 上的默认浏览器。即便如此，还是用者寥寥。最终，微软宣布计划将推出基于 Chromium 的“新 Edge 浏览器”（Chromium 即为 Google 的开源浏览器项目）。


;Here we’ll compare our Firefox Browser to the Chromium-based Microsoft Edge in terms of privacy, utility, and portability, to help you have a better understanding of which browser better suits your needs and preferences.
在此，我们将 Firefox 浏览器与基于 Chromium 的 Microsoft Edge 在隐私、实用和跨平台方面进行比较，以便您更好地了解哪款浏览器更符合自身需求与偏好。


;Edge is integrated into the Windows 10 platform and runs in a sandbox environment, meaning it isolates programs and prevents malicious programs from spying on your computer. It has a built-in SmartScreen that scans the reputation of sites you visit and blocks suspicious sites. To enhance privacy, Edge allows you to use biometrics or a PIN with Windows Hello instead of passwords for online authentication.
Edge 已集成至 Windows 10 平台，并在沙盒环境中运行，这意味着它可以隔离程序并防止恶意程序在您的计算机上进行间谍活动。它内置有 SmartScreen 筛选器，可以扫描您访问的网站的信誉，以阻止可疑网站。为了增强隐私性，Edge 还允许您使用 Windows Hello 中的生物识别手段或 PIN 码代替用于网络身份验证的密码。


;However, Edge saves some of your private data and sends it back to Microsoft with Windows updates. At 45 cryptically worded pages long, the privacy policy for Edge is unlikely to be read or understood by the average user.
然而，Edge 会保存您的某些个人数据，并将其与 Windows 更新一同发送回 Microsoft。Edge 的隐私政策篇幅达 45 页，一般用户不大可能阅读或理解。


;At Firefox, our <a %(attrs)s>privacy policy</a> is transparent and in plain language. We actually put a lot of work into making sure it was straightforward and easy to read. We pride ourselves in protecting our users security and privacy. With Enhanced Tracking Protection now on by default, we block 2000+ trackers automatically. Trackers are those little pieces of code that try to piece together what you're doing across multiple internet sites to build a composite and detailed picture of who you are, compromising your privacy all just to target better ads.
我们的 Firefox <a %(attrs)s>隐私政策</a>是公开透明的，并使用通俗的语言。实际上，我们进行了大量工作来确保它浅显易懂。我们为保护用户的安全和隐私而感到自豪，Firefox 默认情况下即启用增强型跟踪保护，可自动拦截超过 2000 种跟踪器。跟踪器是试图将您在多个网站上的活动汇总的一小段代码，用以勾勒出您的精细数据画像，损害您的隐私，所有这些都是为了更精准地推送广告。


;Your <a %(attrs)s>Privacy Protections</a> shows you the trackers and cookies that pages have attempted to leave, and how many Firefox has blocked for you.
您的<a %(attrs)s>隐私保护</a>页面会显示 Firefox 已为您拦截的跟踪器和 Cookie 数量。


;In Firefox, Private Browsing mode automatically erases your browsing information like passwords, cookies, and history, leaving no trace after you close out the session. Edge on the other hand, actually records browsing history in their private mode (called “InPrivate”) and it’s a relatively easy task for someone to reconstruct your full browsing history, regardless of whether your browsing was done in regular or InPrivate mode.
Firefox 的隐私浏览模式在您关闭对话后会自动清除浏览信息，包括密码、cookie 和浏览历史，不会留下任何痕迹。而 Edge 即使在其隐私模式（叫做“InPrivate”）实际上也会记录浏览历史，因此，不管您是用普通模式还是用 InPrivate 模式上网，重现您的完整浏览历史都是比较容易的事情。


;Both browsers are relatively equal in terms of data encryption. However, if online privacy and transparency are important to you, then Firefox is clearly a better choice here.
两款浏览器在数据加密方面相当。然而，如果网络隐私和透明度对您来说很重要，那么 Firefox 显然是一个更好的选择。


;Firefox is a fast and open source browser, which means users can customize their browsing experience in every way possible. Firefox also allows the casual user several different ways to customize the UI with applying different themes and toolbar configurations. Since our browser has always been open source we have a large following of devoted developers who have created an extensive library of add-ons and browser extensions.
Firefox 是一款快速的开源浏览器，这意味着用户可以通过各种方式定制他们的浏览体验。Firefox 还允许用户通过应用不同的主题和工具栏配置来定制 UI。我们的浏览器一直都是开源的，在众多忠实开发者的共同努力下，我们建立了一套丰富多彩的附加组件和浏览器扩展库。


;Since Edge has moved to the processor intensive Chromium platform, you can expect it to run a little slower, especially if you have multiple programs running at once. However, with Chromium platform comes a massive library of extensions as well as a decent level of UI customization that Edge did not have before it’s move to Chromium.
由于 Edge 已迁移至 CPU 密集型的 Chromium 平台，因此可以预期它运行的速度会变慢，特别是同时运行多个程序时。好的一方面是获得了庞大的扩展库，以及相当不错的 UI 自定义水平，这在 Edge 迁移到 Chromium 之前是不存在的。


;Edge has some nice UI features, like their tab previews which can make it easy to find the right open tabs if you’ve got a lot of them open. Another helpful tab-related feature lets you set aside any active tabs that you aren’t using but don’t want to close down.
Edge 有一些很不错的 UI 功能，如标签页预览，如果您打开了很多标签页，可助您快速找到所需页面。另一项与标签页相关的实用功能是，您可以将任何当前未用但不想关闭的活跃标签页暂时“搁置”。


;Firefox features a scrolling tab interface, which keeps tab information viewable and scrolls them horizontally instead of shrinking them down to just favicon size. Also whenever you open a new tab, our <a %(attrs)s>Pocket feature</a> suggests relevant articles and content for you. Plus with Pocket, you can also save articles, videos, and other content with one click, for reading at a later time.
Firefox 有一个滚动标签页的功能，它保持标签页信息可见并能够水平滚动，而不是将其缩小到仅显示图标的大小。同样，只要您打开新标签，我们的<a %(attrs)s> Pocket 功能</a>就会为您推荐相关的文章和内容。另外，使用 Pocket，您还可以一键保存文章、视频和其他内容，方便后续阅读。


;Firefox and Edge both offer excellent reading modes. With Firefox you just tap on the small icon in the search bar and the browser strips down all unnecessary elements and presents you a clean looking article. In Edge you just tap on the small book icon and browser to get a clean easy-to-read UI.
Firefox 和 Edge 均提供了出色的阅读模式。使用 Firefox，您只需点击地址栏中的小图标，浏览器就会删除所有不必要的元素，为您呈现一篇干净的文章。在 Edge 中，您只需点击“书”图标，即可获得一个干净易读的 UI。


;Firefox also includes lots of handy built-in features by default like <a %(attrs)s>Enhanced Tracking Protection</a>, a built-in screenshot tool, large file sending and more.
Firefox 默认还包含许多便捷的内置功能，例如<a %(attrs)s>增强型跟踪保护</a>、内置截图工具、大文件发送功能等等。


# "Out of the gate" means from the very start. Alternative: "From the start,". Race horses are held behind a gate that is opened to release all the horses at the same time at the start of the race, so a horse that leads the race from the very start is said to lead "right out of the gate."
;Out of the gate, Firefox has more features and integrations built into the browser and readily available on download. And while both browsers have a tremendous number of add-ons and extensions available, Edge’s compatibility with Google’s Chromium platform gives it the advantage in terms of sheer numbers.
Firefox 内置有更多的功能和集成，并可通过下载轻松获得。两款浏览器都有大量附加组件和扩展，但 Edge 因其 Google Chromium 平台的兼容性为其在数量上占据了优势。


;With Internet Explorer, Microsoft learned from its lack of availability across platforms and made Edge available for macOS and Android. The software is now readily available on iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.
Microsoft 吸取了 Internet Explorer 缺乏跨平台可用性的教训，使 Edge 可用于 macOS 和 Android。现在，该软件在 iOS、Android、Windows 和 Mac 上均可使用。


;Firefox has been available on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS and Linux for years. And as you would expect with any modern browser, Firefox lets you log in with a <a %(attrs)s>free account</a> and sync data such as passwords, browsing history, bookmarks, and open tabs between your computer, tablet and phone. It also allows you to sync across platforms as well.
Firefox 在 iOS、Android、Windows、macOS 和 Linux 平台上早已推出多年。正如您对任何现代浏览器的期望，Firefox 允许您使用<a %(attrs)s>免费账户</a>登录并在计算机、平板电脑和手机之间同步数据，如密码、浏览历史、书签和打开的标签页。跨平台同步自然不在话下。


;Edge also allows you to connect your associated Microsoft account and sign in to sync your favorites, history, passwords, and more between your computer and iOS or Android devices, although some Android tablets are not currently supported.
Edge 还允许连接您关联的 Microsoft 账户，以在计算机与 iOS 或 Android 设备之间同步您的收藏夹、历史记录、密码等，尽管目前某些 Android 平板电脑不在支持范围 。


;Aside from sucking up a lot of computing power, Edge running on Chromium has answered a lot of users’ needs for functionality and features. But there’s still a lot to account for in terms of the browser’s privacy protections. It’s our assessment that Firefox is still a better choice for most people to use in their daily lives, based not only on functionality but more importantly on our transparency in how we collect user data, what exactly we collect, and what we do with it. Because our parent company is <a %(attrs)s>Mozilla</a>, a non-profit organization dedicated to internet privacy and freedom, we simply have a different set of priorities when it comes to users’ data.
撇除占用大量运算资源不说，基于 Chromium 的 Edge 已能够满足大多数用户对功能和特性的需求。但就浏览器的隐私保护而言，还有很多要考虑的地方。我们认为，功能很重要，收集用户数据的方式、内容以及处理方式方面的透明度同样重要，对于大多数人来说，Firefox 仍然是更好的选择。因为我们的母公司是 <a %(attrs)s>Mozilla</a>，一个致力于互联网隐私和自由的非营利组织，充分尊重用户的数据隐私。


;The bottom line is that while we suggest using Firefox, the best browser for you ultimately will be the one that fits your individual needs with extension support, browsing tools customization, speed, privacy and security.
尽管我们建议您使用 Firefox，但最适合您的浏览器终将是一款能够满足您个性化需求，扩展支持、浏览工具定制、速度、隐私和安全等方面俱佳的浏览器。
