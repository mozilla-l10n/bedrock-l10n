;Comparing Firefox Browser with Opera
Firefox 浏览器与 Opera 之间的比较


;The Firefox Browser and Opera are two of the earliest browsers on the scene still releasing frequent updates. While Opera has not reached the same level of user adoption as Firefox or Google Chrome, it’s maintained a relatively stable and loyal base over a sustained period of time. In this review, we’ll compare the Opera browser with our Firefox browser in terms of security and privacy, utility, and portability to help you choose which browser might be the best fit for you.
Opera 是为数不多的与 Firefox 浏览器一样推出很久，且仍在频繁更新的浏览器。尽管 Opera 的用户使用率还未达到 Firefox 或 Google Chrome 的水平，但 Opera 长时间以来依然维持有一群稳定和忠诚的用户。在这篇评比中，我们将 Firefox 浏览器与 Opera 浏览器在安全、隐私、实用和跨平台方面比较，以确定哪款浏览器更适合您。


;Opera’s privacy policy lacks some specificity in its explanation of which types of information it collects and how, in certain sections, it says they collect names of account holders, IP addresses and search terms. What seems confusing and troubling is the section about International data transfers; when, how often and why they need to transfer your data internationally is not explained.
Opera 的隐私政策在解释其收集哪些类型的信息以及如何在某些部分收集账户持有者的姓名、IP 地址和搜索词时缺乏具体说明。最令人困惑和不安的是关于国际数据传输的部分：没有解释将您的数据在国际范围内传输的时间、频率及原因。


;Firefox’s <a %(attrs)s>privacy policy</a> is very transparent in describing what personal information we collect with the only end goal being to give you greater control over the information you share online.
Firefox 的<a %(attrs)s>隐私政策</a>在描述我们收集哪些个人信息时非常透明，最终目的就是让您对自己的网络数据掌有更大的控制权。


;As far as actual privacy protections in the Opera browser, it does offer a robust Private mode that allows you to surf the web without the browser tracking your activity. Also in normal browsing mode, you can also turn off some data collection features by digging into the settings to enable the ad blocker and adjust other security features.
至于 Opera 浏览器中的隐私保护，它确实提供了强大的“隐身”模式，让您在不被浏览器跟踪活动的情况下上网冲浪。同时在正常浏览模式下，您也可以花点工夫设置启用广告拦截程序，并调整其他安全功能来关闭一些数据收集功能。


;With the latest version of Firefox, <a %(attrs)s>Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> is turned on by default in normal browsing mode, so you don’t have to mess around with the settings just to protect yourself from trackers. With Enhanced Tracking Protection, Firefox actively blocks thousands of third-party trackers that try to follow you around the web. You are provided with a personalized protection report that shows how often Firefox blocked third-party cookies, social media trackers, fingerprinting tools and cryptominers as you browse the web.
在最新版本的 Firefox 中，<a %(attrs)s>增强型跟踪保护</a>在正常浏览模式下即默认处于启用状态，省心省力。通过增强型跟踪保护，Firefox 可以主动拦截成千上万试图跟踪您的第三方网络跟踪器。系统会为您生成个性化的保护报告，该报告显示了当您浏览网络时，Firefox 所拦截的第三方 Cookie、社交媒体跟踪器、数字指纹跟踪程序和加密货币挖矿程序的频次。


;We make Firefox for people like you, who care deeply about personal privacy and security. That's why we collect so little info about users and are transparent about how we use that info. It's hard to know how Opera is operating from a privacy perspective. While there are robust privacy features, how they themselves collect and share your data is murky. Firefox remains consistent in what we say and what we do in protecting your privacy.
我们为重视个人隐私和安全的人们构建 Firefox，这就是为什么我们只收集很少的用户信息，并对我们如何使用该信息完全透明的原因。从隐私的角度来说很难知道 Opera 的运营模式。尽管附有强大的隐私功能，但它们本身如何收集和分享您的数据却是个谜。Firefox 郑重承诺在保护您的隐私方面，言行保持一致。


;There’s no debate that Opera is a feature-packed browser with a clean user interface and strong customization options. Because Opera is built on Chromium, it can take advantage of most of Google Chrome’s vast extension library. Firefox also features a large <a %(attrs)s>extension library to browse</a>, but not quite as large as Chrome’s.
毫无疑问，Opera 是一款功能强大的浏览器，拥有简洁的用户界面和强大的自定义选项。由于 Opera 是基于 Chromium 构建的，因此可以使用大多数的 Google Chrome 浏览器扩展。Firefox 也提供了一个大型<a %(attrs)s>扩展库</a>，但没有 Chrome 那么庞大。


;Like Firefox, Opera delivers a scrolling tab experience, which means that when you open more tabs than will fit on screen, it scrolls them off screen instead of just continuously shrinking them down. Also both Firefox and Opera have a screenshot tool that lets you capture a snapshot of your screen or part of the page. However, the Opera tool doesn’t give you the ability to create one huge capture of the whole webpage, only the visible portion.
与 Firefox 一样，Opera 也提供了滚动标签页的特性，这意味着当您打开的标签页超出屏幕所能显示的数量时，Opera 会将其滚动出屏幕，而不是将其不断缩小。Firefox 和 Opera 均内置有屏幕截图工具，可让您截取屏幕或页面部分区域。但 Opera 工具不能截取整个页面，只可截取可见范围。


;Opera provides a lot of hidden utility within its simple and manageable interface. For example there’s built-in support for messaging apps, like Facebook Messenger. There’s also a news reader that aggregates articles from your choice of sites and news outlets. The parallel feature to this on Firefox is called <a %(attrs)s>Pocket</a>. Pocket is a free service for Firefox account holders that makes it easy to find and save interesting articles and videos from all around the web. In addition, it recommends a variety of articles that expand your knowledge base curated by real, thoughtful humans.

;In terms of head to head utility, Opera and Firefox are close competitors. Opera may have an advantage in one aspect with its compatibility with and access to Chrome’s huge extension library. But one significant factor to consider is the fact that Opera, because it’s built on Chromium, is a processor-hungry browser with its RAM consumption comparable to Chrome, which is known for its high CPU usage.
就实用性来说，Opera 和 Firefox 不相上下。但 Opera 可能在扩展方面有优势，因为它兼容于 Chrome 庞大的扩展库且可以正常访问。但有一点需要考虑的重要因素是，Opera 是基于 Chromium 而构建的，这就意味着它是一款 CPU 密集型浏览器，其内存消耗量与 Chrome 相当，而 Chrome 以 CPU 使用率高而闻名。


# "Ex" is a former partner or spouse, as in "ex-boyfriend" or "ex-wife." Alternative: "former partner"
;Both Firefox and Opera are compatible across every platform including Windows, Mac, Linux, Android and iOS. Firefox account holders can easily sync their bookmarks, passwords, open tabs, and browsing history across all their signed into devices. The same is true for Opera users with an account. However, many sites, especially old sites that haven’t been updated in years, block the latest version of Opera entirely. So if visiting places like your Ex’s old blog is important, take heed, you may not be able to access some of the dustier corners of the internet if you use Opera.

;In addition to the regular mobile app, Opera has two other mobile versions of its browser: Touch and Mini. Touch is light on features but it’s designed to use on the go with only one hand. The Mini version aims at lowering data usage and increased speeds on slow connections by downgrading images and stripping away content.
除了普通版移动 App 外，Opera 还有另外两款移动端浏览器：Opera Touch 和 Mini。Touch 的特点是轻量级，专为单手操作设计。Mini 版本主打节省流量，并通过降低图像质量和简化页面，提升慢速网络下的浏览体验。


;We also offer an additional, albeit experimental version of our Firefox mobile app, <a %(attrs)s>Firefox Preview</a>, which focuses on speed and security.
我们还提供了另外一个实验版 Firefox App。<a %(attrs)s>Firefox Preview</a>，该版本专注于速度和安全性。


;Most major browsers these days, with the exception of Safari, work seamlessly across platforms and browsers. Opera and Firefox are no exception with both browsers providing excellent portability across every device.
如今，除了 Safari 之外，大多数主流浏览器都可以无缝地跨平台运行和浏览。 Opera 和 Firefox 也不例外，这两款浏览器均有着出色的跨平台性。


;Overall, Opera is a solid browser, with a clean interface and a lot of useful features available. There are, however, some serious privacy concerns as well as an issue with it using a lot of processing power. Although Opera has some really terrific ease of use features, we still believe Firefox remains a superior browser based on performance and with a transparent user-privacy stance and strict privacy protections.
